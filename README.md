Introduction - 

Welcome to my Java Projects Showcase Repository. This repository has been curated to provide potential employers and collaborators with a comprehensive view of my Java programming skills and projects. Each project in this repository represents a significant aspect of my proficiency, creativity, and dedication to the world of Java development.

Repository Contents

Here's an overview of the projects you will find in this repository:

Project 1: Java Class Extension
Description: In this project, I extended the Java Point class and introduced new classes: Shape, Rectangle, Circle, and Test. This project showcases object-oriented programming principles and the practical application of Java language features.

Project 2: Greenhouse Simulator
Description: The Greenhouse Simulator is a Java-based application designed to replicate a greenhouse's climate control system. It automates the regulation of soil moisture, humidity, and temperature, making it a valuable tool for greenhouse owners to test and evaluate their climate control systems.

Project 3: Mortgage Calculator
Description: This project, part of "Introduction to Computer Science II," involves creating a Mortgage Calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java and Swing libraries. Users can enter the number of monthly payments, the principal, and the annual interest rate to calculate various mortgage-related values. The application follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern and includes features like different payment frequencies and the option to generate a payment schedule.
