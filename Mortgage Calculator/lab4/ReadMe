Mortgage Calculator
This application calculates mortgage payments and other important financial details using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. The program is written in Java and uses the Swing library for the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Requirements
* Java 8 or later
* An IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) or a command-line interface
Installation
1. Clone or download the project from the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or command-line interface.
Usage
1. Run the Main.java file.
2. Enter the number of monthly payments (amortization), the principal (total amount loaned), and the annual interest rate in the corresponding text fields.
    * Click on the "Calculate" button to display the following information:
    * The amount of the blended monthly payment (principal + interest)
    * The total interest paid over the length of the mortgage
    * The total interest and principal
    * The interest/principal ratio
    * The average interest paid per year
    * The average interest paid per month
    * The amortization expressed in years
Formulae
B = Pi / (1-((i+1)^n))
Where:
* B is the amount of the periodic blended payment (principal + interest)
* P is the principal
* i is the interest factor (calculated using the formula below)
* n is the number of payments over the length of the mortgage
i = ([r/c + 1]^(c/f)) - 1
Where:
* i is the interest factor expressed as a fraction (not percent)
* r is the annual interest rate (a fraction)
* c is the compounding frequency per year (usually 2 for mortgages, i.e. every 6 months or semi-annually)
* f is the frequency of payments per year (e.g. 12 for monthly payments).
Project Structure
All classes are organized into a package named "lab4".
* MortgageModel.java - This class represents the model of the MVC design pattern.
* MortgageView.java - This class represents the view of the MVC design pattern.
* MortgageController.java - This class represents the controller of the MVC design pattern and where the main class will run.
